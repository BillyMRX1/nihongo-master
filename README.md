```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the app.

## Deployment

The app is designed to run as a static site on GitHub Pages.

1. Update the `base` path in `vite.config.ts` to match your repo name
2. Run `npm run deploy`
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings (source: gh-pages branch)

See `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for detailed instructions.

## Tech Stack

Built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS v4.

Key libraries:
- Zustand for state management
- React Router for navigation
- HanziWriter for stroke order animations
- Framer Motion for UI animations
- Chart.js for progress visualization

## How the SRS Works

Characters progress through 6 mastery levels with increasing review intervals:
- Level 0 (New): Review immediately
- Level 1 (Learning): 1 day
- Level 2 (Familiar): 3 days
- Level 3 (Known): 7 days
- Level 4 (Mastered): 14 days
- Level 5 (Burned): 30+ days

Incorrect answers decrease mastery level; correct answers increase it.

## Future Plans

Some ideas for future development:

- Vocabulary mode with example sentences (JMdict integration)
- Study calendar/heatmap visualization
- Sentence practice mode
- Custom deck creation
- Anki deck import/export
- Daily challenge system
